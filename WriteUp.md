# Benefits of contributing to open source projects
---
#### Helps you improve your coding techniques

    When coding with others on a project, you are forced to reevaluate the best way to 
    implement your code. When someone reviews your pull request, they will give helpful 
    criticism which you can learn from and take with you as you continue to contribute to 
    technical projects.

#### Opportunity to work on your communication

    To work with others, you communicate your reasoning for how and why you implemented your 
    code the way you did.

#### Increase visibility in the community

    When contributing to open source projects, you allow others to view your work and 
    continued effort to the community which helps your standing in the community but 
    also how future prosepective employers might view you as you move along.
    
#### And the obvious...

    Help improve peoples programs!

# How to find open source projects
---

First, we must be able to find these open source projects. There are two different 
ways (that I've found) to find these open source projects.

1. Search in the github search bar using a qualifier
- Go to [Github](https://www.github.com)
- In the search bar...
    - Enter in the qualifier in the form -> [label-you-are-searching-for]:>n
    - **good-first-issues:>2 javascript** here we see a label of "good-first-issues", 
    a repo containing more than 2 issues, and contains the keyword "javascript"

 2. Go to a number of websites which have found the repos and aggregated them into lists
 based on labels or issues. A list of websites I've found are...
- [First Timers Only](https://www.firsttimersonly.com/)

- [Code Triage](https://www.codetriage.com/)

- [Github repo of big open source projects by language](https://github.com/MunGell/awesome-for-beginners)

- [Open Hatch](https://openhatch.org/search/?q=&language=JavaScript)

- [Open Source Fridays by Github](https://opensourcefriday.com/)

- [Contrib](https://gauger.io/contrib/#/language/javascript)

- [Fixme](https://fixme.ossn.club/)

- [ContributorNinja: Organized by language](https://contributor.ninja/)

- [Up For Grabs](https://up-for-grabs.net/#/)

Soo many links... There are more than this but this, plus the github search/explore options provide endless 
ways to find the right open source project for you!
