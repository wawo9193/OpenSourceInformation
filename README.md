# Benefits of contributing to open source projects

#### Helps you improve your coding techniques

    When coding with others on a project, you are forced to reevaluate the best way to implement your code. 
    When someone reviews your pull request, they will give helpful criticism which you can learn from and 
    take with you as you continue to contribute to technical projects.

#### Opportunity to work on your communication

    To work with others, you communicate your reasoning for how and why you implemented your code the way you did.

#### Increase visibility in the community

    When contributing to open source projects, you allow others to view your work and continued effort to the 
    community which helps your standing in the community but also how future prosepective employers might view you 
    as you move along.
